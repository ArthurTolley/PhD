The scattered light project from 2016 has a lot of code that is probably terrible and out of date.
In order to continue this work I need to update a lot of the code, write it all out properly and add to it.
Alongside doing a lot of testing to see if it still works.

Steps in no particular order:
- Create a scattered light template bank
- Gather enough testing data
- Write complete functions with proper descriptions
- Remove scattered light over a full O3a chunk
- Demonstrate an improvement in sensitivity
- PyCBC clustering of scattered light artefacts
- Have it all properly implemented in PyCBC
- Short duration scattered light artefacts?

In general, a lot to consider and a lot to work on if this is a step that i'd like to go.
There are a lot of things that might need to be added.
A lot of the functions that I have written, there probably already exists a PyCBC function that does that thing but a lot better and a lot faster.
